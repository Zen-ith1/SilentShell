Rubber Ducky Staging Payload
____________________________________________________

- opens powershell in admininstator use.

- drags the powershell console off screen.

- runs powershell commands 
(Ex. have code execute Computer-Info and then save file to Rubber ducky)

_____________________________________________________

NOTES: 

No inject.bin file because code needs completed before execution. this is the beggining stage of a staged payload. use this to make your future payloads more sly at the start.
